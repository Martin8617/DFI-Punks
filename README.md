# DFI-Punks

The NFTs for the punks are available at OpenSea (https://opensea.io/collection/dfi-punks). The first hundred punks are for sale, but the sale price is an estimate and we can arrange individually. Of course also in DFI (to avoid high fees).

> **NOTE**: Everybody who likes to have a custom-made personal DFI punk is welcome to contact me at Telegram (@Martin8617).

The punks have both the collected attributes of the crypto punks and new ones. Given are the cap and the background. Main difference is the cap with either DFI logo or DFX, BTC, Cake, ... 

Some example how they can look:

The compilations show the available attributes like hair, eyes, skin, ears, mouth and accessories. Skin color is black, dark, normal (shown) and white. Don't hesitate to ask me for your special wishes:
