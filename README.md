# DFI-Punks
### Crypto punks freshly made for the DeFiChain community

Punks for direct sale are available at OpenSea (https://opensea.io/collection/dfi-punks). However the sales price is an estimate and we can agree individually to pay in DFI (also too avoid hugh fees).

> **NOTE**: Everybody who likes to have a custom-made personal DFI punk is welcome to contact me at Telegram (@Martin8617).

The punks have the collected attributes of the crypto punks as well as new ones. The rules are the cap and the background. Main difference is the cap either with DFI-logo or DFX, BTC, Cake, ... 

Some example how they can look:

The compilation shows the available attributes like hair, eyes, skin, ears, mounth, accessories. Skin color is black, dark normal (shown) and white. Don't hesitate to ask for special wishes:
